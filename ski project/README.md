Hi!! Welcome to my first side project. I have decided to make it skiing themed because I grew up skiing and love to ski in my spare time. This project specifically uses information from Seven Springs, where I ski most frequently.

My end goal is to make an interactive list of ski slopes at a given mountain; as of right now, this is a backend project which uses a command line interface. This project was created and to be used in IntelliJ.
To view the project, open SkiMountainCLI which can be found in com.techelevator and run the application. This will give the user a menu of options to choose from. As of right now, option 1 is functional, and the next options are a work in progress.
More specifics about what the project does are listed below:

I have created a text file containing information about the slopes at Seven Springs, which is utilized by the SlopeListBuilder class I have created.
This uses a Scanner which parses through my text file to add each slope to a slope list (each slope in this list has an associated name, and slope type).
With this information the user can currently choose for the CLI to display a list of all slopes.

The next step I am working on currently is creating a method to allow the user to list slopes by difficulty level, i.e. "Show me a list of all beginner slopes."
After this, I will also create a method which will tell the user the difficulty level of a slope when provided with the slope's name.

Eventually I would like to add more functionalities including more information on accessing slope's, such as a list of chairlifts that can be taken to get to different areas on the mountain.

I would love to hear if you try it out and have any comments or suggestions for improvement! Thanks for reading!
